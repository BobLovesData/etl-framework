# v1.0 Release

On 14Dec20, we released what we consider version 1.0 of the framework.

Why did it take nine years to get to v1.0? Two reasons.

1. The framework represents the collective knowledge of numerous data warehouse engagements over the past decade. We are constantly adding to its capability.
2. And this is the really important one. We have never had the time to fully document everything.

With the recent changes, we now feel like any database professional can download the framework and get up and running without having to figure out or guess at the functionality of various elements.

Key updates to v1.0 include:

1. Full documentation.
2. Introduction of Python as a replacement for SSIS.
3. PySpark sample scripts for processing large amounts of historical data.
