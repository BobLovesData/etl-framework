# Framework Objectives

The ELT Framework was built to handle specific challenges we have overcome in organizations:

1. Getting rid of the need to alter code before deploying to production, an awful practice that is allowed in far too many organizations,
2. Preventing clunky unmanageable data systems that waste time and money, and
3. Preventing poor and downright incorrect ETL methodology.

We hope you will find the ETL Framework as efficient and effective as we have. There is always room for improvement, and we welcome forks and pull requests.
