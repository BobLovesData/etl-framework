# Transact SQL

Every stored procedure needs to have a documentation block. The block needs to include the name of the developer, the date the script was created, a description of what the script does, and a log of the changes to the script. All T-SQL scripts need to conform to the following conventions:

1. All scripts need to be left justified.
2. All SQL reserve words need to be capitalized.
