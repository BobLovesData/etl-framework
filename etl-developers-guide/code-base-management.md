# Source Control

Source control is key to good DataOps. Do not manage code by scripting out database objects from prod. Your code needs to be managed professionally. This can be a challenge because many data engineers have not worked in a professional software engineering environment.

I recommend that you use Git for source control. If your team is not familiar with Git, it is worth it to invest the time in training them especially if you are an agile shop. They need to be able to use the full functionality of Git including branching, merging, and pull request.
