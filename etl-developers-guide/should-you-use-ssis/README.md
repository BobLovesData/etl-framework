# Why You Should Not Use SSIS

Should You Use SSIS to build your ETL processes?

Not just no but hell no. 

Non! 

Not just no but no in French!

Microsoft created a great mid-market database. Unfortunately, they really focused on the database and kind of phoned in ancillary components like SSIS.

Sometimes executives will say things like, "we're a Microsoft shop" like it's 2010 and there aren't better options. But it doesn't matter. We're a Microsoft shop and we're going all in on Microsoft like it's David S. Pumpkins.

If you should find yourself working in this kind of toxic environment, I've got your back. What follows are very precise and well founded arguments that developing ETL with point and click tools is not in the organization's best interest. It's all about time and time is money.

BTW, for those that didn't get the reference...
