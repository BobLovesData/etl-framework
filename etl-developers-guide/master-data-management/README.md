# Master Data Management

Master Data Management is not fully integrated into the framework at this time. There is a solution for a limited use case where fuzzy matching is not necessary.

Conditions:

1. The same data comes from more than one source system.
2. The matching process is an exact match on source system keys.

If all we need to do is just match keys and make a unique record, then you can use the framework to develop an MDM solution. The process is described below.
