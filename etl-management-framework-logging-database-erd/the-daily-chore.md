# The Daily Chore

Even though the framework only reports adverse events, emails can still get lost in the blizzard of enterprise environments. It checking the folder for alerts has to be a daily task even if it's nothing more than seeing if the folder has any new emails. 

This is particularly frustrating because it is a problem that you cannot really code for. Additionally, having to check the folder takes away some of the benefit of the self monitoring features. Ideally, alerts of adverse events should go to something dedicated to monitoring the load.
