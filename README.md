This is a framework for moving data into and out of an enterprise data warehouse \(EDW\). It includes everything you need to set up a self-service data analytics platform.

There should be ZERO references to any specific system or database aside from Reporting and ODS. If you should find such a reference, please log an issue on GitHub.

The ETL Framework is not a piece of software with an executable that can be downloaded and installed.  It is a set of principals, practices, example database objects, and other tools one can use to rapidly develop an organizations business analytics capabilities.

Implementing the framework in your environment is a heavy manual process that requires some enterprise architecture choices be made on day one. This document is presented as a comprehensive user's manual of how to implement, maintain, and upgrade the framework for your specific use case.
