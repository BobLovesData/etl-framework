# Table Object Sample Scripts

These scripts are used to create various tables and table support objects. Each table script comes with an  index on the column used to identify a unique row. That index is used to load the table from the common model or used to match fact records to records in staging tables.

The indexes are optional. They may or may not speed up performance depending on your use case and environment.
