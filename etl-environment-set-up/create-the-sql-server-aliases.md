# Create The SQL Server Aliases

This setting makes the assumption that server names are relatively set in stone. If server names change, then it is preferable to use actual IP addresses. Create both 32 and 64bit aliases and make sure TCP/IP is enabled.

Create an alias with the following settings:

Name: \[Data Warehouse Name\]

IP: \[Server Name\]
