# Independent Identically Executing Processes

In conjunction with decoupled systems is the concept of independent identically executing processes. IIE processes are:

* decoupled and executed in isolation from other processes
* execute exactly the same as the same class of object

The framework provides a pattern for each step of the data flow. Within that pattern is a standardized method of processing data. All pulls work exactly the same. All dimension loads work exactly the same etc.

This is another example of speed of development. In order to create new things, all you have to do is pick the process, cut and paste from the template, and make minor alterations to fit your specific scenario. In many cases, the alterations you have to make to code is simply dropping in the necessary columns and you are done.
