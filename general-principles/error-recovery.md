# Error Recovery

Error recovery is designed to be as easy as possible. In many cases, it can be as simple as flipping a flag and rerunning the process.

Even in sophisticated error scenarios, after you have resolved the issue, getting the database back up and running by running unprocessed data without having to do a bunch of modifications to code or some special process. This is also a deliberate design principal of the framework even though it naturally shakes out from other concepts like decoupled systems and IIE processes.
