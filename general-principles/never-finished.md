# Never Finished

What you see before you is not perfection. I will be making git commits to this project at my funeral. 

What this project actually represents is a PRUSUIT of perfection. It is never finished. There will always be new approaches, new techniques, new technologies to research and integrate into the framework.

Finished is not the goal. Research, development, refinement, and evolution towards perfection is.
