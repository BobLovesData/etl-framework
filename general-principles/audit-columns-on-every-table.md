# Data Provenance

Finding out where data came from is a key element of the framework as it assists in error recovery. 

It goes beyond just having columns in tables that indicate source systems. The provenance of data is tracked from the source system all the way to EDW and there are several checks that are part of the monitoring process to ensure that all the data got from where it is going, to where it is supposed to go.
