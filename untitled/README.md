# Standard SSIS ETL Development Package

**The Standard SSIS ETL Development Package has been deprecated in the framework and is not being actively developed. While the tables that support the operation of SSIS packages have been created as part of the framework deployment, these tables are vestigial in nature. Better to keep them around just in case.**

To ease development a standard template has been built so developers can focus on business logic and not worry about the details of logging. Additionally, the standard package allows ease of promotion from development to production without significant changes to the package itself.
