# Tracking Package Variables

If you have a variable that you want to track, set that variableâ€™s raise change event property to true.

It is important that you do NOT delete any of the existing variables with the exception of intVariable2 and strVariable1. Those variables are place holders for package configurations. If you have configurations, you can replace them. If you do not, they need to stay or in the alternative, you can delete the Import Configurations task which is not advised.
